#### SYSTEM DESIGN
- Don't go into details early.
- Don't suggest one solution everywhere. 
- Keep it simple stupid.
- Don't just say things without justification. Be sure about what you speak. 
Most of the times you may feel to blabber.
- Be tech Aware. Zookeeper, Cassandra, PostgreSQL , Kafka, MQ, Cloud Storage, distributed systems, HDFS.

 **Clarity of thoughts** - It is required so that you are able to communicate clearly. </p>
 **Flexibility with design** - will only come if you are tech aware. While preparation go through our own solution and figure out why it should or should not be used.
 
Why a system design interview?
- Technical ability to lead a team.
- Problem solving.
- Able to explain stuffs.
- Design Skills.

 _How to train yourselves? (Skill Development)_
 
 Think on your own for half an hour. I think that's enough. 
 Watch a video. Search for online available answers. 
 Compare solutions.
 Draw it, explain it to yourself.
 Revise after a week.
 Write a read me for that.
 Foresee failures or problems your system may get in future.
 Think about implementing a product/feature that you are using.
